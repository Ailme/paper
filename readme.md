# Paper

Hassle-free HTML to PDF conversion abstraction library.

## Installation

```
composer require asyncphp/paper
```

For best results, you should also install [Prince](https://www.princexml.com) and [WKHTMLtoDPF](http://wkhtmltopdf.org). To run the tests, you'll also need to install [diff-pdf](https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf). If you don't have the latter installed, you'll not be able to run the tests. If you don't have the former installed, the relevant tests will be skipped, and drivers unusable.

## Usage

You can use any of the drivers directly:

```php
use AsyncInterop\Loop;
use AsyncPHP\Paper\Driver\DomDriver;
use AsyncPHP\Paper\Driver\PrinceDriver;
use AsyncPHP\Paper\Driver\WebkitDriver;

$dom = new DomDriver();
$prince = new PrinceDriver($binary = "/path/to/prince", $tempPath = "/path/to/temp");
$webkit = new WebkitDriver($binary = "/path/to/wkhtmltopdf", $tempPath = "/path/to/temp");

Loop::execute(Amp\wrap(function() use ($dom) {
    yield $dom
        ->html($sample)
        ->size("A4")
        ->orientation("portrait")
        ->dpi(300)
        ->render();
}));
```

However, it's must easier to use the factory, to create pre-configured drivers:

```php
use AsyncPHP\Paper\Factory;

$config = [
    "driver" => "dom",

    "dom" => [
        "options" => [
            "fontDir" => __DIR__ . "/fonts",
            // https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/master/src/Options.php
        ],
    ],

    "prince" => [
        "binary" => "/opt/prince/bin/prince",
        "tempPath" => __DIR__,
        "options" => [
            "--no-compress",
            "--http-timeout" => 10,
            // https://www.princexml.com/doc/command-line/#command-line
        ],
    ],

    "webkit" => [
        "binary" => "/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf",
        "tempPath" => __DIR__,
        "options" => [
            "--grayscale",
            "--javascript-delay" => 500,
            // http://wkhtmltopdf.org/usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt
        ],
    ],
];

$factory = new Factory();
$driver = $factory->createDriver($config);

yield $driver->html("hello world")->render();
```

Paper takes an async-first approach. Operations, like rendering PDF files, are particularly suited to parallel processing architecture. You may be stuck rending PDF files in a synchronous architecture, in which case you can use the `SyncDriver` decorator:

```php
$driver = new SyncDriver(new DomDriver());
$driver->html("hello world")->render();

// ...or with the factory

$factory = new Factory();

$driver = $factory->createDriver([
    "driver" => "dom",
    "sync" => true,
]);

$driver->html("hello world")->render();
```
